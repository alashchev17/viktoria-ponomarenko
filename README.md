# Project Overview

This project is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework that enables several functionalities, including server-side rendering and generating static websites. The project structure follows the conventions of a typical Next.js application, and it has been bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Webpage Sections

The webpage consists of several key sections, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **Hero Section**: The main banner of the webpage, which typically includes a headline and a call-to-action button.
2. **Slogan Section**: A section dedicated to the slogan or main message of the website.
3. **Services Section**: This section showcases the various services offered, each represented by a service card.
4. **Reviews Section**: A section displaying customer reviews, including a review slider for better user experience.
5. **Channel Section**: Information about different channels through which users can engage or follow.
6. **Contacts Section**: Provides contact information and possibly a contact form for users to reach out.
7. **Accordion Section**: An interactive section that can expand and collapse to show or hide additional information.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes a variety of modern web technologies and tools:

- **Next.js**: The core framework used for building the application.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, which Next.js is built upon.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.
- **Sanity.io**: A headless CMS used for managing and delivering content.
- **PostCSS**: A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code.
- **Prettier**: A code formatter to ensure consistent code style.

## Development and Deployment

### Development

To start the development server, you can use one of the following commands:

- `npm run dev`
- `yarn dev`
- `pnpm dev`
- `bun dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Deployment

The easiest way to deploy the Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js. Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
